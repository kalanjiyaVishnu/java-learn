## Arrays

- Lexicographically Smallest Permutation of String
- Palindrome Rearrangement
- check the leader(the element in the array must be greater than the all element in the right most of the array)
- rotate array
  - 1 2 3 4 5
  - 3 4 5 1 2
  - A B C D E
  - C D E A B
- get denomination for the given mony deno = (1,2,5,10,50,100) input 1200, 500 , 242 ==>output 12[100] 5[100] 7[2*100 + 4*10 + 1 *1]
- get the matching pairs of the array input a value and a array (find the pairs of the array)
- get the intersection of the array
- separate the zeros from the number
- B maximum and minimum element in the array
- B find the second largest element in the array
## string

- check the pan format length = 10 first 5 must me capitalized char and next must be numbers
- spy number (both addition and mul give the same res) 
  example 123 6==6 is a spy number
- BUZZ number (it is div by 7) 
## recursion

- fibbonicci series
- printing the seq from 0 to n (7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0) (-7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0)
- power of a num (2,3) (2 _ 2 _ 2) = 3
- sum of arithmetic series from 1 to N
