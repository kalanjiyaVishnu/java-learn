Rahul has got a new phone.He is getting lots of messages on Facebook and many of them are from girls.But he knows many boys uses fake ID to prank others. So he designed a method to guess whether the user who messaged him is a male or female. If the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female.

You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our Rahul to determine the gender of this user by his method

Input Format

The first-line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters â€” the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

Constraints

1<=length of string<=1000

Output Format

If it is a female by our Chandu's method (the number of distinct characters is 'ODD' ), print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).
